This project is a web application designed to process and visualize .csv files interactively. Users can upload datasets, explore data summaries, and generate visualizations without needing technical expertise.



Here's why:
* Efficiency:
  1. The application processes uploaded .csv files instantly, converting them into structured DataFrames for analysis. This ensures rapid feedback for users without              delays.
  2. By leveraging Pandas and Plotly, the app quickly generates statistical summaries and visualizations, saving users time compared to manual data exploration.
  3. Data is stored in the session during the user’s interaction, minimizing redundant processing and enhancing performance.
  
* Accessibility: Easy-to-use interface ensures that users can efficiently manage and review transactions.
  1. With clear navigation between data upload, preview, and visualization pages, the app is intuitive for users of all skill levels.
  2. Users don’t need programming expertise to upload datasets, view summaries, or create visualizations.
  3. Being a web application, it requires no installation. Users can simply run the server locally or deploy it online for use from any browser.
